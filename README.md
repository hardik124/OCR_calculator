# OCR_calculator
This project aims to build an open source calculator for android which can take input in the form of image and process the text detected in the image by its OCR module . 
The calculator at its first release stage will be able to 
1)Solve simple linear equations 
2)Solve expressions
3)Show range for inequalities
4)Plot graphs of simple polynomial equations.

The project will include 2 seperate modules , 
1)An OCR module which will process image to detect text 
2)An android app to handle the framework and to provide a platform for the OCR module to run.
